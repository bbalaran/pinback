# Mission
Finding and aggregating concerts that you’re interested in has always been a challenge. This core problem brought rise to our greenfield Project, a project dedicated to bringing ease and convenience to your concert planning experience. 

# How It Works
Our core functionality prides itself in its simplicity: tell us your location and a date range, and we’ll show you a beautiful map with venues and their corresponding events. 

Every venue that populates on the map is clickable, so that you can get detailed information about events and the respective artists that will be performing. 

Feel free to click “Add an Event” or “Delete an Event” and we’ll update your events list for you. 

# How We Did It
Our hardworking team of four put this web application together using the MEAN Stack. 

For our beautiful map views, we utilized an open-source mapping platform called MapBox that allows us to integrate location queries with custom map design. 

For our thorough concert data, we tapped into the BandsInTown API, which provides us with artists, bands, call-to-action links, and more. 

“Greenfield Project really makes it so easy for me to find out what’s poppin in my area and check out my events whenever I want!” says avid user Avicii. 

“Everyone on our development team is a music fanatic, and so this product really hits home. We can’t wait for the public to enjoy our platform,” says database engineer and scrum master Rob.
